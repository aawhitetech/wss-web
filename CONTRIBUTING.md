# Contributing to Bookstore

We value all of our contributors and hope that this guide makes the contribution process smooth and enjoyable for everyone.

## Getting Started

Fork this repository on GitHub to start making your changes to the main branch (or branch off of it).
Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.
Send a pull request and bug us until we merge it!

## Contribution Guidelines
### Coding conventions

- Indentation: We use spaces, not tabs.
- Comments: Use them to explain the why, not the how.
- Follow existing style: Look at the existing code and try to emulate its style.

### Commit messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Pull requests

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the repository.
- Be sure to tag any issues your pull request is taking care of / contributing to, so that we can keep track of what's going on.
- We might ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or giving tips on how to improve the code. Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:
  - Write tests.
  - Write a good commit message.

### Issues

If you find any bugs, discrepancies, or other issues, please open an issue on GitHub and we'll look into it!

### Testing

Before submitting your changes, ensure:

- All existing tests pass (and you do not break anything).
- New features have appropriate tests.
