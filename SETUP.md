### **React Bootstrap Project Setup**

Welcome to the React Bootstrap project. This guide will help you set up your development environment and get started with React and Bootstrap.

#### **1. Setting up Node.js**

Before proceeding, ensure that you have Node.js set up on your machine. We recommend using the LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Node.js.

**Follow the instructions in [./docs/setup_nvm.md](./docs/setup_nvm.md)** to:
- Install `nvm` (Node Version Manager).
- Use `nvm` to install the LTS version of Node.js.

Once you've followed the guide, verify your Node.js and npm installations:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### **2. Setting up React**

We will use `create-react-app` to set up our React project:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

After installing `create-react-app`, initialize a new React project:

```bash
npx create-react-app wss-web
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd wss-web
```

#### **3. Integrating Bootstrap**

To include Bootstrap in our React project, we'll use the `react-bootstrap` library along with Bootstrap's CSS.

Install `react-bootstrap` and Bootstrap:

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

Now, to use Bootstrap components, you can import them in your React files:

```javascript
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
```

Also, make sure to import the Bootstrap CSS in your `src/index.js` or `src/App.js`:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

#### **4. Running Your React App**

With everything set up, you can now run your React app:

```bash
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

#### **5. Conclusion**

You've successfully set up a React project with Bootstrap integration. Refer to the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/) and [React-Bootstrap documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for more information on building your app.
